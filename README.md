**Admin Login**:

Email: admin@test.com

Password: admin

The **Task** (API) streamlines employee task assignments and progress tracking. Designed to support both admin and employee workflows, it provides a secure and efficient way to create, manage, and monitor tasks. The system leverages a robust backend built with Spring Boot and integrates JWT-based authentication for secure access and data is persisted in a relational database.

üîë Key Features:
- Admin and Employee roles with JWT-secured authentication

- User registration and login with role assignment

- Task assignment by admins to employees

- Task filtering, searching, and status updates

- Role-based comment system on tasks

- Clean and responsive API

- Secure password handling

üì¶ Technologies:
- Spring Boot (RESTful Web Services)

- Spring Security + JWT (Authentication & Authorization)

- MySQL (Relational Database)

- Lombok, JPA, Hibernate (Productive Java coding)

- Docker (Containerized Deployment)

‚úÖ Design & Architecture:
- Modular layered architecture

- Separation of concerns via interfaces and service implementations

- Repository pattern for database interaction

- DTOs and mappers for clean data transfer

### 1. Layered Architecture
This divides the system into horizontal layers, each with a specific responsibility:

- Controller Layer (Presentation): Handles HTTP requests/responses, often using Spring's @RestController.

- Service Layer (Business Logic): Contains core logic, validations, and coordinates between components.

- Repository Layer (Persistence): Interacts with the database using interfaces and ORM tools like JPA.

- Model/DTO Layer: Represents the data objects transferred between layers.

### 2. Modular Architecture
This divides the system into independent feature-based modules, such as:

- auth/ ‚Üí everything related to login, signup

- admin/ ‚Üí everything related to admin

- employee/ ‚Üí everything related to employee
